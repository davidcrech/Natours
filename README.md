# 🌿 Natours API

> Complete RESTful API for a fictional tours booking app.

This project is part of my Node.js learning journey, based on building a production-grade backend with Node.js, Express, and MongoDB.  

It handles CRUD operations, authentication, authorization, file uploads, geospatial queries, and much more.
